### General comments on paper quality:
- Well-written and quite interesting paper.

### Comments:
- Does a good job describing different notions of calibration (Definition 1 - 3).

- Classwise-ECE intuitively makes sense as a reasonable metric. 

- I did not quite follow the paragraph on interpretability (or figure 2).

- The experiments seem extensive and rigorously conducted. 

- So, matrix scaling (with ODIR regularization) outperforms Dirichlet calibration?
