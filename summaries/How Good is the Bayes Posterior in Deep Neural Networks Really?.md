### General comments on paper quality:
- Somewhat well-written and interesting paper.

### Comments:
- Quite odd paper. They refer to the appendix a whole lot, this work is not really suited for an 8 page paper IMO. They present a bunch of hypotheses, but I do not quite know what to do with in the end. The paper is rather inconclusive.

- I found it somewhat odd that they only evaluate the methods in terms of predictive performance, that is usually not the reason why people turn to Bayesian deep learning models.
